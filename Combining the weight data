# Ok so tody I am merging three data sets. I'm going to attempt to do this in 
# under one hour. 

# Here is my game plan: 
# (1) get the average for each FID
# (2) Filter the document with FID code + tracts for just the tracts in the census doc
# (3) Then pull the FID codes from the weight csv by using %in%
# (4) Then merge it to the census+ tract file by FID code
# (5) then merge that data set to the census data doc 

# OK Let's go!!!

# First I need to load in all my data sets
#weights, my_census, FID_Tract

# Load in required packages
library(dplyr)

# Ok the code below will get the mean weights. 
mean_weights <- weights %>% 
  group_by(first.0) %>%
  select(first.0, secon.120)%>%
  summarize(mean= mean(secon.120))

# Ok now I need to get the 119 tracts present in the census data
mc_tracts<- my_census$tract
# this is a character

# Now I need to go into FID_Tract and pull only the tracts present in the census data
# We will call this FT for fid and tracts. 
ft <- FID_Tract %>%
  select(FID_1, TRACTCE) %>%
  filter(TRACTCE %in% mc_tracts)
# Only 107 tracts; Missing 001005 and one other. 

# Get the FID codes we want. I'm just taking all the environment room I need 
# Today I guess...
fidcodes<- ft$FID_1

# Now select codes from weight data
mean_weights <- mean_weights %>%
  filter(first.0 %in% fidcodes)

# Merge mean weights and ft by FID. First I have to rename one of them to match
colnames(mean_weights)[colnames(mean_weights) == 'first.0'] <- 'FID_1'
weights_and_tracts<- left_join(mean_weights, ft, by = "FID_1")
View(weights_and_tracts)

#Rename mean
colnames(weights_and_tracts)[colnames(weights_and_tracts) == "mean"] <- "mean_weights"
colnames(weights_and_tracts)[colnames(weights_and_tracts) == "TRACTCE"] <- "tract"

# Lastly, left join it to the census data 
City_Of_Miami_variables_Sept_5 <- my_census %>%
  filter(tract %in% weights_and_tracts$tract) 

City_Of_Miami_variables_September_5 <- 
  left_join(City_Of_Miami_variables_Sept_5, weights_and_tracts, by = "tract" )

write.csv(City_Of_Miami_variables_September_5, 
          "City_Of_Miami_variables_September_5.csv")
