# August 30th...

# Today I am going to clean up the call data and send that to one of the Doctors working on the project with
# Dr. Hagen. 

# I did some prior cleaning in excel and  so I am left with a data set containing only city of Miami
# 311 service reports and then I am also left with data only containing phone, n.mobile == "smartphone app"
# and the other categories. 

# My first task is to select only the tracts that have census data tied to them. 
# Then I want to label mobile, android, and iphone and label them to a new category called "Smartphone App" 
# I'm not sure if I should make the delayed variable but I will anyway. 
# Maybe also attach in another dataset: 
   # The number of calls per tract
   # the number of calls per tract per category
   # then the number of delayed calls per tract

# The data sets I am using are: 
   # City_Miami_census_Aug28.csv 
   # Aug30CallData.csv

# First I want to select the tracts present in City Miami census
View(City_Miami_census)
# To grab the tracts I will just select the tract column of th data set and save it to a vector. 
city_of_miami_tracts <- City_Miami_census$tract

# Using the above vector I will  select only the tracts that we want from the csv file Aug30CallData
# Read in the file

# There are other isssues I see as well such as that some actual.days are equal to zero.
